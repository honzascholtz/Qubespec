      "content": "Here is a comprehensive project plan for converting QubeSpec from `emcee` to JAX and BlackJAX nested sampling.\n\n***\n\n## Project: QubeSpec Sampler Migration to JAX + BlackJAX\n\n**Objective**: To refactor the QubeSpec spectral fitting package by replacing the existing `numpy`/`emcee`-based MCMC backend with a modern, high-performance backend using `JAX` and `BlackJAX` nested sampling. This will enable significant performance gains on modern hardware (GPUs/TPUs) and introduce robust Bayesian evidence calculation for model comparison.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Technical Analysis\n\nThe migration from an `emcee`-based MCMC approach to a `BlackJAX`-based nested sampling approach involves a fundamental paradigm shift from imperative, process-parallelized computation to a functional, vectorized framework.\n\n**Key Architectural Differences:**\n\n| Feature | Current Architecture (QubeSpec + emcee) | Target Architecture (QubeSpec + BlackJAX) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Core Libraries** | `numpy`, `scipy`, `emcee`, `numba` | `jax`, `jax.numpy`, `jax.scipy`, `blackjax` |\n| **Programming Model** | Object-Oriented (`Fitting` class manages state). Imperative control flow. | Functional (pure functions for models, priors, likelihoods). JIT compilation (`jax.jit`) is central. |\n| **Parallelization** | Process-based via `multiprocess`. High overhead, scales poorly beyond a few dozen CPU cores. | Data-based via `jax.vmap`. Extremely efficient vectorization for parallel execution on GPUs/TPUs. |\n| **Sampling Method** | MCMC (Affine-invariant ensemble sampler). Explores the posterior distribution. | Nested Sampling. Calculates Bayesian evidence (logZ) and produces posterior samples as a byproduct. |\n| **Model & Prior Code** | Python/NumPy functions, often accelerated with `@numba.njit`. | Pure JAX functions using `jax.numpy` (`jnp`) and `jax.scipy.stats`. |\n| **Data Handling** | `numpy.ndarray` and `numpy.ma.MaskedArray`. | `jax.numpy.ndarray`. Masks must be handled explicitly (e.g., using `jnp.nan` and `jnp.nansum`). |\n| **Result Analysis** | Custom chain processing and `corner.py`. | `anesthetic` library for processing nested sampling output and plotting. |\n| **Key Benefit** | Well-established and robust posterior sampling. | **1.** Drastically improved performance for cube analysis. **2.** Bayesian evidence for statistical model comparison. |\n\n---\n\n### 2. Migration Strategy\n\nThe project will be executed in four distinct phases to manage complexity, ensure continuous integration, and validate results at each stage.\n\n*   **Phase 1: Foundational JAX Conversion.** The initial focus will be on converting the \"innermost loop\" of the fitting process—the models and priors—to be JAX-compatible. This isolates the core numerical code from the broader workflow, allowing for focused development and testing.\n*   **Phase 2: Single-Spaxel Integration.** With JAX-native models available, the next step is to build a functional single-spaxel fitting routine using `blackjax.nss`. This new routine will be wrapped to temporarily replace the `emcee` call, allowing for direct comparison and validation on 1D spectra.\n*   **Phase 3: Vectorization for Cube Analysis.** This is the most critical phase for performance. The single-spaxel fitting function will be vectorized using `jax.vmap`, replacing the inefficient `multiprocess` loop and enabling simultaneous fitting of thousands of spaxels on an accelerator.\n*   **Phase 4: Finalization and Cleanup.** The final phase involves updating the post-processing and plotting tools to handle the new output format from BlackJAX/`anesthetic`, writing comprehensive documentation and tutorials, and removing the legacy `emcee`-based code.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Core Components for Conversion\n\nThe following components of the QubeSpec codebase are the primary targets for refactoring:\n\n1.  **Spectral Models (`QubeSpec/Models/`)**:\n    *   All model functions (e.g., `Halpha_OIII_models.Halpha_OIII`, `gauss`) must be rewritten as pure JAX functions using `jax.numpy` and `jax.scipy`.\n    *   The use of `astropy.modeling.powerlaws.PowerLaw1D` must be replaced with a JAX-native equivalent.\n    *   The FeII template interpolation (`FeII_models.py`), which currently uses `scipy.interpolate`, must be converted to use `jnp.interp` to be JIT-compatible.\n\n2.  **Prior and Likelihood Functions (`QubeSpec/Fitting/`)**:\n    *   The `priors.py` module must be replaced with a JAX-native implementation. The `logprior_general` function will be rewritten to use `jax.scipy.stats` for standard distributions (normal, uniform) and custom JAX logic for others (log-uniform, truncated normal).\n    *   The log-likelihood calculation within `fits_r.py:log_probability_general` must be extracted into a pure JAX function that takes parameters and data as inputs.\n\n3.  **Fitting and Analysis Infrastructure**:\n    *   **Fitting Engine (`fits_r.py`)**: The `Fitting` class and its `emcee`-based methods will be entirely replaced by a new module (`QubeSpec/Fitting_JAX/`) that orchestrates the BlackJAX nested sampling run.\n    *   **Spaxel Processing (`Spaxel_fitting/Spaxel.py`)**: The `multiprocess` loop will be replaced by a `jax.vmap` implementation for vectorized fitting across the data cube.\n    *   **Map Creation (`Maps/Map_creation.py`)**: Post-processing functions must be updated to parse the output of BlackJAX and `anesthetic` instead of the current `emcee` chain dictionaries.\n    *   **Utilities (`Utils/Support.py`)**: Functions for calculating posterior properties (e.g., `flux_calc_mcmc`, `W80_..._calc`) must be adapted to work with the new results format.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Implementation Tasks & Timeline\n\nThe following is a detailed breakdown of tasks and estimated timelines, assuming a single contractor working 40 hours/week.\n\n**Total Estimated Duration: 9 Weeks**\n\n| Phase | Task ID | Deliverable | Estimated Time |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **1. Core JAX Conversion** | 1.1 | **JAX Models**: A new `QubeSpec/Models_JAX/` module containing all spectral models converted to pure JAX functions. | 5 days |\n| | 1.2 | **JAX FeII Interpolation**: The `FeII_models.py` module is updated to use `jnp.interp`. | 2 days |\n| | 1.3 | **JAX Priors**: A new `QubeSpec/Fitting_JAX/priors.py` module with a JIT-compatible `log_prior` function. | 2 days |\n| | 1.4 | **JAX Likelihood**: A pure JAX log-likelihood function is created in the new fitting module. | 1 day |\n| **2. Single-Spaxel Fitting** | 2.1 | **BlackJAX Spaxel Fitter**: A `fit_spaxel_jax` function that can perform a complete nested sampling run on a single spectrum. | 5 days |\n| | 2.2 | **Bridging Class**: A temporary wrapper class, `FittingJAX`, that mimics the old `emcee` interface but uses the new BlackJAX backend. | 3 days |\n| | 2.3 | **Integration Test**: The `D1_spectra_collapse` method is successfully running fits on 1D spectra using the new backend, with results validated against the old backend. | 2 days |\n| **3. Vectorized Fitting** | 3.1 | **`vmap`-compatible Fitter**: Refactor `fit_spaxel_jax` to be compatible with `jax.vmap`. | 5 days |\n| | 3.2 | **Vectorized Cube Fitter**: A new `fit_cube_vmap` function that applies the spaxel fitter across an entire data cube using `jax.vmap`. | 5 days |\n| | 3.3 | **Memory Management**: Implement batching logic within `fit_cube_vmap` to handle large data cubes that do not fit into GPU memory. | 3 days |\n| | 3.4 | **Final Integration**: A new `Spaxel_JAX.py` module that replaces the `multiprocess` logic with the new `vmap`-based approach. | 2 days |\n| **4. Finalization** | 4.1 | **Updated Post-Processing**: `Map_creation.py` and utility functions are updated to use the BlackJAX/`anesthetic` output format. | 4 days |\n| | 4.2 | **Updated Plotting**: `Plotting/plots.py` is updated. Corner plots now generated via `anesthetic`. | 3 days |\n| | 4.3 | **Test Suite**: A test suite comparing outputs of the old and new pipelines is delivered and passes. | 2 days |\n| | 4.4 | **Documentation & Cleanup**: User-facing documentation and tutorials are updated. Old `emcee` code is removed. | 1 day |\n\n---\n\n### 5. Testing Strategy\n\nValidation will be performed at every stage to ensure the scientific integrity of the results.\n\n*   **Unit Tests**: All JAX-converted model and prior functions will be tested against their original NumPy/Numba counterparts to ensure numerical equivalence.\n*   **Integration Test**: The new BlackJAX-based single-spaxel fitter will be validated against the existing `emcee` fitter using the 1D spectra from the QubeSpec tutorial. The resulting posteriors (means, standard deviations, and corner plots) must be statistically consistent.\n*   **End-to-End Validation**: A full data cube will be analyzed with both the old and new pipelines. The resulting flux and kinematic maps will be compared directly. Difference maps should show no systematic deviations and be consistent with statistical noise.\n*   **Evidence Sanity Check**: For a simple model, the Bayesian evidence (logZ) computed by BlackJAX will be cross-checked against the output of another trusted nested sampling code (e.g., `dynesty`) to confirm the implementation is sound.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Risk Assessment\n\n| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Difficulty of JAX Conversion**: The existing object-oriented structure may be difficult to translate into JAX's functional paradigm. | The project is phased to isolate functional conversion from workflow integration. The contractor must have demonstrated experience with JAX. |\n| **GPU Memory Limitations**: The `vmap` approach may exceed GPU memory for very large data cubes. | The project plan explicitly includes a task (3.3) to implement a batching/chunking mechanism for the `vmap` call, allowing it to process arbitrarily large cubes. |\n| **Bugs in Re-implementation**: Subtle errors in the JAX model/prior functions could lead to incorrect scientific results. | A rigorous, multi-level testing strategy is mandated, including direct numerical comparisons and statistical validation of posteriors against the original, trusted code. |\n| **BlackJAX Immaturity**: As a newer library, `blackjax.nss` may have undiscovered bugs or limitations. | The provided workshop script serves as a validated template. The contractor will begin by replicating this known-good example. Direct communication channels with the BlackJAX development team will be established. |\n\n---\n\n### 7. Performance Considerations\n\n*   **Expected Benefits**:\n    1.  **Speed**: A significant performance increase (est. 10-100x) for full-cube analysis on GPU hardware due to the efficiency of `jax.vmap` over `multiprocess`.\n    2.  **Model Comparison**: Native calculation of the Bayesian evidence (logZ) will replace the less accurate BIC approximation, enabling statistically robust model selection (e.g., outflow vs. no-outflow).\n    3.  **Modernization**: The package will be aligned with the modern high-performance Python ecosystem, improving maintainability and opening the door for future extensions like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) or Simulation-Based Inference (SBI).\n\n*   **Potential Issues**:\n    1.  **JIT Overhead**: The first run of a JIT-compiled function includes a compilation cost. This may make single-spaxel fits appear slower on the first execution, but this cost is amortized over a full cube, where the overall speed will be much greater.\n    2.  **CPU Performance**: While still expected to be faster due to JIT, the performance gain on CPU-only machines will be less dramatic than on GPUs. JAX's CPU dispatching will be used to maximize CPU performance.",

      "content": "Of course. This is a classic and challenging step in high-performance scientific computing. The \"hanging\" issue is a common symptom of a few specific problems when integrating with JAX and its ecosystem.\n\nBased on a detailed analysis of your `nested_sampling.py` and the `workshop_nested_sampling.py` example, the root cause is a misunderstanding of the `handley-lab/blackjax` nested sampling API, specifically how the main loop, convergence, and finalization steps work.\n\nLet's break it down.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Identifying the Correct BlackJAX API for Nested Sampling\n\nThe `handley-lab` fork introduces a stateful nested sampling object where the `step` function returns both the updated `live` state and the `dead` points from that iteration. Your current implementation misinterprets this return signature and uses an incorrect convergence criterion.\n\nHere is a summary of the key API differences between your implementation and the correct workshop approach:\n\n| Feature | Your Implementation (`nested_sampling.py`) | Correct Workshop API (`workshop_nested_sampling.py`) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **`step` function return** | `live, info = step_fn(...)` | `live, dead_info = step_fn(...)` |\n| **Dead Point Collection** | `if hasattr(info, 'dead_point'): dead.append(info.dead_point)` | `dead.append(dead_info)` (The returned object *is* the dead points) |\n| **Convergence Check** | `while iteration < max_iterations:` and `if info.log_evidence_err < tolerance:` | `while not live.logZ_live - live.logZ < -3:` (Evidence-based) |\n| **Finalization** | **Missing.** The remaining live points are discarded. | `dead = blackjax.ns.utils.finalise(live, dead)` (Crucial step) |\n| **Result Processing** | `nested_samples = NestedSamples(data=np.array(samples_array), ...)` | `NestedSamples(data, logL=dead.loglikelihood, logL_birth=dead.loglikelihood_birth, ...)` |\n\nThe most critical errors are the **incorrect convergence check** and the **missing finalization step**. Your code is likely not \"hanging\" but running for the full `max_iterations` (e.g., 10,000 steps), which can take a very long time, and then producing incorrect results because it discards the final live points.\n\n### 2. Working Example: How to Properly Integrate\n\nHere is a corrected version of your `JAXNestedSampler.fit_spectrum` method. This implements the correct API calls based on the workshop example.\n\n```python\n# In JAXNestedSampler class within nested_sampling.py\n\ndef fit_spectrum(self, \n                 wavelength: ArrayLike, \n                 flux: ArrayLike, \n                 error: ArrayLike,\n                 model_name: str,\n                 priors: Dict[str, List],\n                 param_names: List[str],\n                 num_inner_steps_multiplier: int = 5,\n                 convergence_criterion: float = -3.0) -> NestedSamplingResults:\n    \"\"\"\n    Fit a spectrum using nested sampling with the correct BlackJAX API.\n    \n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    ...\n    num_inner_steps_multiplier : int\n        Multiplier for num_dims to set the number of inner MCMC steps.\n    convergence_criterion : float\n        Convergence criterion based on logZ - logZ_live.\n        \n    Returns\n    -------\n    NestedSamplingResults\n    \"\"\"\n    start_time = time.time()\n    \n    # 1.

Debugging Why Your Nested Sampling Might Be Hanging\n\nThe primary reason for the \"hang\" is the faulty loop structure. However, other issues can cause genuine hangs or extremely slow convergence:\n\n1.  **Faulty Convergence Check**: As identified, your `while iteration < max_iterations` loop combined with a check on `info.log_evidence_err` (which is never found) forces the sampler to run for the maximum number of steps. This is the most likely culprit.\n2.  **Numerical Instability (`NaN`s)**: If your JAX model or likelihood function produces `NaN` or `inf` for some parameter combinations, the sampler can get stuck. The MCMC steps inside the nested sampler fail to find new points, and the algorithm stalls.\n    *   **Debug Tip**: Temporarily disable JIT (`@jit`) on your functions and insert `print` statements or `jax.debug.print` inside your likelihood to check for `NaN` values in the model output or the final log-likelihood value.\n3.  **Incorrect Priors**: If your prior bounds are too wide or do not cover the high-likelihood region, the sampler will spend an enormous amount of time exploring empty space before it starts finding meaningful points, making it appear to hang.\n4.  **Parameter Ordering Bug**: Your `_create_dict_likelihood` wrapper is a potential source of bugs. If the order of `param_names` does not exactly match the order expected by your array-based `log_likelihood` function, the model will receive incorrect parameters, likely resulting in a log-likelihood of `-inf` everywhere and causing the sampler to stall.\n\n### 4. Best Approach for Reliable Implementation\n\n1.  **Adopt Dictionaries Natively**: The `blackjax` nested sampler is designed to work seamlessly with dictionaries of parameters. Refactor your `log_likelihood` and model functions to accept a dictionary of parameters directly. This eliminates the need for the `_create_dict_likelihood` wrapper and the `param_names` list, making your code far more robust and less prone to ordering bugs.\n\n    ```python\n    # In likelihood.py\n    def create_log_likelihood_function(model_func, wavelength, flux, error):\n        def log_likelihood(params: Dict[str, float]): # Takes a dictionary\n            model_flux = model_func(params, wavelength) # Model also takes a dict\n            residuals = flux - model_flux\n            chi2 = jnp.sum((residuals / error)**2)\n            return -0.5 * chi2\n        return log_likelihood\n    ```\n\n2.  **Start Simple and Validate**: Before fitting your complex astronomical model, use your `JAXNestedSampler` class to fit the simple line model from the workshop. This will confirm that your integration with the BlackJAX API is correct in a controlled environment where you know the answer.\n\n3.  **True Vectorization with `vmap`**: Your `fit_cube_vectorized` method is currently using a standard Python `for` loop, which does not provide any of the performance benefits of JAX. To get the 10-100x speedup, you must refactor the *entire fitting logic* into a single function that can be vectorized with `jax.vmap`.\n\n    **This is a significant but essential step.** The structure would look something like this:\n\n    ```python\n    # A new, fully-vectorized function\n    def fit_spaxel_vmappable(key, flux, error, wavelength, model_func, prior_bounds, ...):\n        # All the logic from the corrected fit_spectrum method goes here.\n        # It must be pure JAX, with no Python loops or external libraries.\n        # The convergence loop needs to be a `jax.lax.while_loop`.\n        ...\n        return results_tuple # (logZ, mean_params, std_params, ...)\n    \n    # In your JAXNestedSampler class:\n    def fit_cube_vmap(self, ...):\n        # ... setup ...\n        \n        # Vectorize the single-spaxel fitter\n        vmapped_fitter = jax.vmap(\n            fit_spaxel_vmappable, \n            in_axes=(0, 0, 0, None, None, None, ...) # Map over keys, flux, error\n        )\n        \n        # Generate a key for each spaxel\n        keys = jax.random.split(self.rng_key, num_spaxels)\n        \n        # Run all fits in parallel on the GPU\n        all_results = vmapped_fitter(keys, flux_cube, error_cube, wavelength, ...)\n        \n        return all_results\n    ```\n    This is an advanced topic. Focus on getting the single-spaxel fit working correctly first, then tackle the `vmap` conversion.\n\nBy applying the corrected API usage from the workshop, you should immediately solve the \"hanging\" issue and get your nested sampling runs to converge correctly, providing you with the Bayesian evidence you need.",

      "content": "Of course. This is an excellent and common situation in scientific code conversion. The \"it runs but the results are wrong\" phase is often the most challenging to debug. After a thorough analysis of your provided files, I've identified several fundamental issues that, when combined, produce exactly the behavior you're seeing.\n\nThe good news is that these are specific, fixable problems. The \"success\" proclaimed in your demo script is premature; the underlying physics and computation are incorrect.\n\nHere is a detailed technical critique and a clear path to fixing your implementation.\n\n---\n\n### Executive Summary of Issues\n\n1.  **Critical Unit Mismatch**: The core model function `fwhm_to_sigma` incorrectly interprets the `nar_fwhm` parameter, treating it as if it were in **meters/second** when the priors and true values are in **kilometers/second**. This is the primary cause of the catastrophic parameter recovery. The sampler is trying to fit a model that is physically nonsensical.\n2.  **No True Vectorization**: Your `fit_cube_vectorized` function uses a standard Python `for` loop. It is **not vectorized** and does not use `jax.vmap`. This is why you are seeing only a ~1.1x speedup (from JIT on single-spaxel fits) instead of the expected 10-100x.\n3.  **Fragile Parameter Handling**: Your use of a `_create_dict_likelihood` wrapper to convert dictionaries to arrays is a fragile design pattern. The working workshop example passes dictionaries natively, which is far more robust.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n#### 1. The Fundamental Issue: Catastrophic Parameter Recovery (Unit Mismatch)\n\nYour parameter recovery is failing because the model is not interpreting the parameters correctly. The smoking gun is in `QubeSpec/Models_JAX/core_models.py`.\n\nIn the function `fwhm_to_sigma`:\n```python\n# In core_models.py\n@jit\ndef fwhm_to_sigma(fwhm: float, center_wavelength: float) -> float:\n    # ...\n    # This line is incorrect\n    velocity_fraction = (fwhm / 1000.0) / (C / 1000.0)  # km/s to c\n    # ...\n```\n\nLet's break down this line:\n*   `C` is defined as `3e8` (the speed of light in m/s).\n*   `C / 1000.0` correctly converts this to `3e5` (km/s).\n*   Your `true_params` and priors define `nar_fwhm` in **km/s** (e.g., `true: 280.0`).\n*   The expression `fwhm / 1000.0` incorrectly divides this value by 1000, effectively converting it from km/s to Mm/s (megameters per second). The code is treating the input `fwhm` as if it were in **m/s**.\n\n**Consequence:** When the sampler provides a value like `280.0` for `nar_fwhm`, your model calculates a line width based on an FWHM of `0.280` km/s. This is an incredibly narrow line, essentially a delta function. The model flux will not match the data at all. The likelihood surface becomes flat and uninformative, causing the sampler to wander aimlessly within the prior bounds and return garbage results. The 97σ deviation is a clear symptom of this total failure to converge on a meaningful solution.\n\n**The Fix:**\nThe `fwhm` parameter is already in km/s, so you should not divide it by 1000.\n\n**Change this line in `core_models.py`:**\n```python\n# Incorrect\nvelocity_fraction = (fwhm / 1000.0) / (C / 1000.0)\n```\n**To this:**\n```python\n# Correct\nvelocity_fraction = fwhm / (C / 1000.0)  # fwhm is in km/s, C/1000 is in km/s\n```\n\nThis single change will likely fix the catastrophic parameter recovery issue entirely.\n\n#### 2. The Performance Issue: Why is it only 1.1x faster?\n\nThe expected 10-100x speedup from JAX comes from vectorizing operations across a large data cube using `jax.vmap`, which executes all fits in parallel on a GPU. Your implementation does not do this.\n\nIn `nested_sampling.py`, your `fit_cube_vectorized` function contains this:\n```python\n# This is a standard Python loop, NOT vectorized parallelism\nfor j in range(batch_flux.shape[0]):\n    result = self.fit_spectrum(...)\n    batch_results.append(result)\n```\nThis loop runs `fit_spectrum` sequentially for each spaxel. You are not using `jax.vmap` at all. The minor 1.1x speedup you observe is simply the benefit of JIT-compiling the functions for a single fit, which has a small but noticeable effect.\n\n**The Fix:**\nAchieving the desired performance requires a major refactoring. You must:\n1.  Isolate the entire nested sampling loop for a single spaxel into a pure JAX function. This function cannot contain Python loops (`while not ...`) or Python list appends (`dead.append(...)`). It must be rewritten using `jax.lax.while_loop`.\n2.  Wrap this pure function with `jax.vmap`, mapping it over the axes of your flux and error cubes.\n\nThis is a non-trivial task that represents the final and most powerful step of the JAX conversion.\n\n#### 3. The Implementation Issue: Comparison to the Workshop Example\n\nYour implementation deviates from the robust design of the workshop example in a key way.\n\n*   **Workshop (`workshop_nested_sampling.py`):** The likelihood function (`line_loglikelihood`) natively accepts a dictionary of parameters. This is robust because it's immune to parameter ordering bugs.\n    ```python\n    def line_loglikelihood(params):\n        m, c, sigma = params[\"m\"], params[\"c\"], params[\"sigma\"]\n        # ...\n    ```\n*   **Your Code (`nested_sampling.py`):** Your models and likelihoods are based on the order of arguments in a Python function. You use a wrapper, `_create_dict_likelihood`, to convert the dictionary from BlackJAX back into an ordered array.\n    ```python\n    def _create_dict_likelihood(self, log_likelihood: Callable, param_names: List[str]) -> Callable:\n        def dict_likelihood(params_dict):\n            params_array = jnp.array([params_dict[name] for name in param_names])\n            return log_likelihood(params_array)\n        return dict_likelihood\n    ```\nWhile your parameter ordering seems correct for now, this design is fragile. If the `param_names` list ever mismatches the function signature of your model, you will get silent, catastrophic errors.\n\n**The Fix:**\nRefactor your model functions (`halpha_oiii_model`, etc.) and your `create_log_likelihood_function` to accept a dictionary of parameters directly, just like the workshop example. This eliminates the need for the wrapper and makes your code safer and easier to debug.\n\n### Recommendations for a Path Forward\n\nFollow these steps in order to fix your implementation:\n\n1.  **Fix the Critical Unit Bug (Immediate Priority):**\n    *   In `QubeSpec/Models_JAX/core_models.py`, correct the `fwhm_to_sigma` function as described above.\n    *   Re-run your `demo_jax_with_saved_plots.py` script. The parameter recovery should now be sensible, and the massive sigma deviations should disappear.\n\n2.  **Adopt a More Robust Design:**\n    *   Modify your model functions in `core_models.py` to accept a dictionary of parameters, e.g., `def halpha_oiii_model(x, params: Dict) -> ArrayLike:`.\n    *   Update `create_log_likelihood_function` to work with this dictionary-based model.\n    *   Remove the `_create_dict_likelihood` wrapper from `JAXNestedSampler` entirely. This will align your code with the best practices shown in the workshop.\n\n3.  **Implement True Vectorization (The Performance Step):**\n    *   Create a new, self-contained function, e.g., `_fit_spaxel_vmappable(key, flux, error, ...)`.\n    *   Inside this function, rewrite the nested sampling `while` loop using `jax.lax.while_loop`. This is the most complex part of the conversion. The loop's state must be a tuple containing the `live` state, the `dead` points array, the RNG key, and an iteration counter.\n    *   Once you have a pure, vmap-compatible spaxel-fitting function, create a new `fit_cube` method that uses `jax.vmap` to apply it to your entire data cube.\n\nBy fixing the unit conversion bug, you will restore the scientific validity of your results. By implementing true vectorization with `vmap`, you will achieve the performance gains that motivated this conversion in the first place.",
