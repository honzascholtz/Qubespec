      "content": "Here is a comprehensive project plan for converting QubeSpec from `emcee` to JAX and BlackJAX nested sampling.\n\n***\n\n## Project: QubeSpec Sampler Migration to JAX + BlackJAX\n\n**Objective**: To refactor the QubeSpec spectral fitting package by replacing the existing `numpy`/`emcee`-based MCMC backend with a modern, high-performance backend using `JAX` and `BlackJAX` nested sampling. This will enable significant performance gains on modern hardware (GPUs/TPUs) and introduce robust Bayesian evidence calculation for model comparison.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Technical Analysis\n\nThe migration from an `emcee`-based MCMC approach to a `BlackJAX`-based nested sampling approach involves a fundamental paradigm shift from imperative, process-parallelized computation to a functional, vectorized framework.\n\n**Key Architectural Differences:**\n\n| Feature | Current Architecture (QubeSpec + emcee) | Target Architecture (QubeSpec + BlackJAX) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Core Libraries** | `numpy`, `scipy`, `emcee`, `numba` | `jax`, `jax.numpy`, `jax.scipy`, `blackjax` |\n| **Programming Model** | Object-Oriented (`Fitting` class manages state). Imperative control flow. | Functional (pure functions for models, priors, likelihoods). JIT compilation (`jax.jit`) is central. |\n| **Parallelization** | Process-based via `multiprocess`. High overhead, scales poorly beyond a few dozen CPU cores. | Data-based via `jax.vmap`. Extremely efficient vectorization for parallel execution on GPUs/TPUs. |\n| **Sampling Method** | MCMC (Affine-invariant ensemble sampler). Explores the posterior distribution. | Nested Sampling. Calculates Bayesian evidence (logZ) and produces posterior samples as a byproduct. |\n| **Model & Prior Code** | Python/NumPy functions, often accelerated with `@numba.njit`. | Pure JAX functions using `jax.numpy` (`jnp`) and `jax.scipy.stats`. |\n| **Data Handling** | `numpy.ndarray` and `numpy.ma.MaskedArray`. | `jax.numpy.ndarray`. Masks must be handled explicitly (e.g., using `jnp.nan` and `jnp.nansum`). |\n| **Result Analysis** | Custom chain processing and `corner.py`. | `anesthetic` library for processing nested sampling output and plotting. |\n| **Key Benefit** | Well-established and robust posterior sampling. | **1.** Drastically improved performance for cube analysis. **2.** Bayesian evidence for statistical model comparison. |\n\n---\n\n### 2. Migration Strategy\n\nThe project will be executed in four distinct phases to manage complexity, ensure continuous integration, and validate results at each stage.\n\n*   **Phase 1: Foundational JAX Conversion.** The initial focus will be on converting the \"innermost loop\" of the fitting process—the models and priors—to be JAX-compatible. This isolates the core numerical code from the broader workflow, allowing for focused development and testing.\n*   **Phase 2: Single-Spaxel Integration.** With JAX-native models available, the next step is to build a functional single-spaxel fitting routine using `blackjax.nss`. This new routine will be wrapped to temporarily replace the `emcee` call, allowing for direct comparison and validation on 1D spectra.\n*   **Phase 3: Vectorization for Cube Analysis.** This is the most critical phase for performance. The single-spaxel fitting function will be vectorized using `jax.vmap`, replacing the inefficient `multiprocess` loop and enabling simultaneous fitting of thousands of spaxels on an accelerator.\n*   **Phase 4: Finalization and Cleanup.** The final phase involves updating the post-processing and plotting tools to handle the new output format from BlackJAX/`anesthetic`, writing comprehensive documentation and tutorials, and removing the legacy `emcee`-based code.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Core Components for Conversion\n\nThe following components of the QubeSpec codebase are the primary targets for refactoring:\n\n1.  **Spectral Models (`QubeSpec/Models/`)**:\n    *   All model functions (e.g., `Halpha_OIII_models.Halpha_OIII`, `gauss`) must be rewritten as pure JAX functions using `jax.numpy` and `jax.scipy`.\n    *   The use of `astropy.modeling.powerlaws.PowerLaw1D` must be replaced with a JAX-native equivalent.\n    *   The FeII template interpolation (`FeII_models.py`), which currently uses `scipy.interpolate`, must be converted to use `jnp.interp` to be JIT-compatible.\n\n2.  **Prior and Likelihood Functions (`QubeSpec/Fitting/`)**:\n    *   The `priors.py` module must be replaced with a JAX-native implementation. The `logprior_general` function will be rewritten to use `jax.scipy.stats` for standard distributions (normal, uniform) and custom JAX logic for others (log-uniform, truncated normal).\n    *   The log-likelihood calculation within `fits_r.py:log_probability_general` must be extracted into a pure JAX function that takes parameters and data as inputs.\n\n3.  **Fitting and Analysis Infrastructure**:\n    *   **Fitting Engine (`fits_r.py`)**: The `Fitting` class and its `emcee`-based methods will be entirely replaced by a new module (`QubeSpec/Fitting_JAX/`) that orchestrates the BlackJAX nested sampling run.\n    *   **Spaxel Processing (`Spaxel_fitting/Spaxel.py`)**: The `multiprocess` loop will be replaced by a `jax.vmap` implementation for vectorized fitting across the data cube.\n    *   **Map Creation (`Maps/Map_creation.py`)**: Post-processing functions must be updated to parse the output of BlackJAX and `anesthetic` instead of the current `emcee` chain dictionaries.\n    *   **Utilities (`Utils/Support.py`)**: Functions for calculating posterior properties (e.g., `flux_calc_mcmc`, `W80_..._calc`) must be adapted to work with the new results format.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Implementation Tasks & Timeline\n\nThe following is a detailed breakdown of tasks and estimated timelines, assuming a single contractor working 40 hours/week.\n\n**Total Estimated Duration: 9 Weeks**\n\n| Phase | Task ID | Deliverable | Estimated Time |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **1. Core JAX Conversion** | 1.1 | **JAX Models**: A new `QubeSpec/Models_JAX/` module containing all spectral models converted to pure JAX functions. | 5 days |\n| | 1.2 | **JAX FeII Interpolation**: The `FeII_models.py` module is updated to use `jnp.interp`. | 2 days |\n| | 1.3 | **JAX Priors**: A new `QubeSpec/Fitting_JAX/priors.py` module with a JIT-compatible `log_prior` function. | 2 days |\n| | 1.4 | **JAX Likelihood**: A pure JAX log-likelihood function is created in the new fitting module. | 1 day |\n| **2. Single-Spaxel Fitting** | 2.1 | **BlackJAX Spaxel Fitter**: A `fit_spaxel_jax` function that can perform a complete nested sampling run on a single spectrum. | 5 days |\n| | 2.2 | **Bridging Class**: A temporary wrapper class, `FittingJAX`, that mimics the old `emcee` interface but uses the new BlackJAX backend. | 3 days |\n| | 2.3 | **Integration Test**: The `D1_spectra_collapse` method is successfully running fits on 1D spectra using the new backend, with results validated against the old backend. | 2 days |\n| **3. Vectorized Fitting** | 3.1 | **`vmap`-compatible Fitter**: Refactor `fit_spaxel_jax` to be compatible with `jax.vmap`. | 5 days |\n| | 3.2 | **Vectorized Cube Fitter**: A new `fit_cube_vmap` function that applies the spaxel fitter across an entire data cube using `jax.vmap`. | 5 days |\n| | 3.3 | **Memory Management**: Implement batching logic within `fit_cube_vmap` to handle large data cubes that do not fit into GPU memory. | 3 days |\n| | 3.4 | **Final Integration**: A new `Spaxel_JAX.py` module that replaces the `multiprocess` logic with the new `vmap`-based approach. | 2 days |\n| **4. Finalization** | 4.1 | **Updated Post-Processing**: `Map_creation.py` and utility functions are updated to use the BlackJAX/`anesthetic` output format. | 4 days |\n| | 4.2 | **Updated Plotting**: `Plotting/plots.py` is updated. Corner plots now generated via `anesthetic`. | 3 days |\n| | 4.3 | **Test Suite**: A test suite comparing outputs of the old and new pipelines is delivered and passes. | 2 days |\n| | 4.4 | **Documentation & Cleanup**: User-facing documentation and tutorials are updated. Old `emcee` code is removed. | 1 day |\n\n---\n\n### 5. Testing Strategy\n\nValidation will be performed at every stage to ensure the scientific integrity of the results.\n\n*   **Unit Tests**: All JAX-converted model and prior functions will be tested against their original NumPy/Numba counterparts to ensure numerical equivalence.\n*   **Integration Test**: The new BlackJAX-based single-spaxel fitter will be validated against the existing `emcee` fitter using the 1D spectra from the QubeSpec tutorial. The resulting posteriors (means, standard deviations, and corner plots) must be statistically consistent.\n*   **End-to-End Validation**: A full data cube will be analyzed with both the old and new pipelines. The resulting flux and kinematic maps will be compared directly. Difference maps should show no systematic deviations and be consistent with statistical noise.\n*   **Evidence Sanity Check**: For a simple model, the Bayesian evidence (logZ) computed by BlackJAX will be cross-checked against the output of another trusted nested sampling code (e.g., `dynesty`) to confirm the implementation is sound.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Risk Assessment\n\n| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Difficulty of JAX Conversion**: The existing object-oriented structure may be difficult to translate into JAX's functional paradigm. | The project is phased to isolate functional conversion from workflow integration. The contractor must have demonstrated experience with JAX. |\n| **GPU Memory Limitations**: The `vmap` approach may exceed GPU memory for very large data cubes. | The project plan explicitly includes a task (3.3) to implement a batching/chunking mechanism for the `vmap` call, allowing it to process arbitrarily large cubes. |\n| **Bugs in Re-implementation**: Subtle errors in the JAX model/prior functions could lead to incorrect scientific results. | A rigorous, multi-level testing strategy is mandated, including direct numerical comparisons and statistical validation of posteriors against the original, trusted code. |\n| **BlackJAX Immaturity**: As a newer library, `blackjax.nss` may have undiscovered bugs or limitations. | The provided workshop script serves as a validated template. The contractor will begin by replicating this known-good example. Direct communication channels with the BlackJAX development team will be established. |\n\n---\n\n### 7. Performance Considerations\n\n*   **Expected Benefits**:\n    1.  **Speed**: A significant performance increase (est. 10-100x) for full-cube analysis on GPU hardware due to the efficiency of `jax.vmap` over `multiprocess`.\n    2.  **Model Comparison**: Native calculation of the Bayesian evidence (logZ) will replace the less accurate BIC approximation, enabling statistically robust model selection (e.g., outflow vs. no-outflow).\n    3.  **Modernization**: The package will be aligned with the modern high-performance Python ecosystem, improving maintainability and opening the door for future extensions like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) or Simulation-Based Inference (SBI).\n\n*   **Potential Issues**:\n    1.  **JIT Overhead**: The first run of a JIT-compiled function includes a compilation cost. This may make single-spaxel fits appear slower on the first execution, but this cost is amortized over a full cube, where the overall speed will be much greater.\n    2.  **CPU Performance**: While still expected to be faster due to JIT, the performance gain on CPU-only machines will be less dramatic than on GPUs. JAX's CPU dispatching will be used to maximize CPU performance.",
