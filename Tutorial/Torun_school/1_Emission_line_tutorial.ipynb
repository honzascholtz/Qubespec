    "We can see a very bright detection of narrow [OIII], but there is also a fainter line right next to it at 3.38 and 3.41 microns. This is the other part of [OIII] doublet and Hbeta line. There is one at restframe 4960 and 4861 angstroms. When fitting the [OIII]5008, we wil have to fit the [OIII] 4960 (full doublet) as well and the Hbeta 4861. \n",

    "2) Hbeta  - one gaussian components\n",
    "4) Continuum - We need to fit the continuum. KMOS and SINFONI are not very sensitive to the features of the continuum hence fitting a line with gradient and normalization is enough. For high SNR data (maybe from JWST?) or local galaxies we would have to fit ppxf models - I have never done it though. \n",

    "2) Because they are coming from the same gas, they have the samw width - sigma (or FWHM) of the line\n",
    "3) The [OIII] has fixed line ratio between the two lines - the [OIII]4960 line has 1/3 of the flux of the [OIII]5008 line. Since the width of these lines is the same, we can say that the ratio of the peaks of these two lines is 2.99. \n",
